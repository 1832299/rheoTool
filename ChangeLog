Version 2.0

Released on 09/02/2018.

o Electrically-driven flows:
	 
	- Add: solvers, libraries, utilities and tutorials for electrically-driven flows.
	 
o Constitutive equations:
	
	- Add: the Rolie-Poly viscoelastic model has been added to the library of constitutive equations. Both the stress and log-conformation versions are available.   
	
	- Add: the (single-equation) eXtended Pom-Pom viscoelastic model has been added to the library of constitutive equations. Both the stress and log-conformation versions are available.   
	
	- Change: sPTT models have been generalized to their full form by replacing the upper-convected derivative by the Gordon-Schowalter derivative. It is now possible to simulate PTT models with non-affine deformation, in both the stress and log-conformation versions.
	
	- Change: the stabilization method in viscoelastic simulations has been made general and run time selectable: none, BSD or coupling.
	
	- Change: a verification step has been added to the WhiteMetznerLog model in order to prevent its incorrect use (see note in the user-guide table with the constitutive equations).  
	
o Post-Processing:
	
	- Add: class ppUtil for post-processing purposes has been added to the versions for OpenFOAM and the one existing for foam-extend has been modified. Enable the use of multiple ppUtil in simultaneous.
	
	- Fix: sampling error was fixed for the tutorials of versions of40 and fe40.
	
o Multiphase flows:
	
    - Change: (fvc::grad(U) & fvc::grad(etaS()*alpha)) has been replaced by fvc::div(etaS()*alpha*dev2(T(fvc::grad(U)))) for the use in multiphase flows (constitutiveEq.C).
	
	- Fix: call to constrainPressure() in reoInterFoam, version of40, has been corrected for the SIMPLEC algorithm (pEqn.H). Added a section in the user-guide on how to use properly the fixedFluxPressure BC with reoInterFoam in versions of222 and fe40. 
	
	- Add: tutorials on the die swell problem.
	
o Generic: 
	
	- Fix: code clean-up and bug fix in BC evaluation of the explicit fvc::div(phi,X) operator in class GaussDefCmpw.
	 
	- Change/Add: replace boundary condition extST by the Type-independent linearExtrapolation boundary condition (no backward compatibility). Added optional second-order regression.
	
	- Change: major update of the user guide to include electrically-driven flows. Other changes were made in its content and organization, and some typos were corrected.
	
	- Change: ensure compatibility with foam-extend 4.0 and OpenFOAM v4.1.
